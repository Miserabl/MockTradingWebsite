This is an Eclipse Dynamic Web Project written primarily in Java and Javascript/HTML/CSS. To run this program, export it into an Eclipse Dynamic Web Project.
Make sure to connect the application to the Apache Tomcat server in the build path.
Run the mySQL script in mySQLworkbench, amd if the username and password of your sql database isn't root, go into the files to change those values.
Lastly, get your own API key from the finhub website and replace the outdated key in the code with that.
